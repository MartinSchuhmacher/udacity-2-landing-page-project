                    <p>But what about any improvements? Can the first section still get better if there is no section above it? The burden of being above everyone else is that you need to find your own motivation to become better. Always strive for the better.</p>

                    <p>Even if there is the inner question of "why can't I be on first place?" the second section still shows itself as being of high value for the page. There can not always be several first places, which makes the second even more important.</p>
